# Maximal Clique Enumeration Project

This project compares the performance of three maximal clique enumeration algorithms: **Chiba**, **ELS**, and **Tomita**, by analyzing their execution times on large graph datasets.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

Maximal clique enumeration is a fundamental problem in graph theory with applications in social network analysis, bioinformatics, and various other fields. This project implements and benchmarks three widely-used algorithms:

- **Chiba**: Known for consistent performance across dataset sizes.
- **ELS**: Fast for small graphs but scales poorly with large graphs.
- **Tomita**: Efficient for small graphs but slows down on large datasets.
